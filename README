Hello! 
This bot uses the keras model from google's teachable machine in order to classify the possible weather on the picture you send it.
Currently the only supported kinds of weather this bot understands are:
  Sunny weather
  Rainy weather
  Snowy weather
I may or may not add more later, it takes quite a bit of time.
Basically, you use the proccess_image command in discord chat (Don't forget to change GUILD_IDS to make it work on your server)
After you input the command, you also have to upload an image. The bot checks whether what you uploaded is an image or not.
After you upload it, the bot tries to guess what kind of weather it is that is shown on the picture. 

Please remember, the bot IS NOT a human. It can still make mistakes, as it's dataset that was used for training was NOT perfect.
(its hard to find big datasets with pictures, and downloading them myself one-by-one is very slow and won't give as good of a result)
